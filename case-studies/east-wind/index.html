              <h2>Brief</h2>
              <p>Design a logo for a private, exclusive property on the island of Antigua that evokes an Asian influence and features the color purple.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="copy">
              <h2>Audience</h2>
              <p>There were two primary audiences for the project: guests hosted by the owners and guests who've leased time at the property.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <figure><img src="../../assets/images/work-east-wind-01.jpg" alt="East Wind logo painted on rustic wood"></figure>
            </div>
            <div class="copy">
              <h2>Strategy</h2>
              <p>Create a logo that embodies an upscale but laid-back and casual island feel and could be utilized for every situation without modification or adjustment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="copy">
              <h2>Intended Outcomes</h2>
              <p>An easily recognizable and distinct logo that would suit the client's (and the property's) every need.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">

            <div class="copy cream">
              <p>I tried several different fonts and treatments before deciding to use Diner in a stacked, vertical arrangement. When the brief changed to include an icon, I made some subtle changes to the typography by using softer, round letter shapes.</p>
  	          <p>For the icon, the client and I agreed that a palm tree was an obvious, but appropriate, choice. I added the setting sun behind the tree as a subtle cue to both the Asian influence and the casual tranquility of the property. The iconography was offset from the word mark through the use of a simple horizontal rule.</p>
