          <p>User Experience Strategy, Design, and HTML/CSS Prototypes</p>
          <h2>TL;DR Overview</h2>
          <p>In 2016 I began to study Panera&rsquo;s digital landscape, looking for ways to capitalize on its strengths as a brand and deliver an elevated digital experience to users. I recognized that the existing digital ecosystem was flawed, and there were missed opportunities to connect with users and drive e-commerce.</p>
          <p>I led the research, strategy, design, and build of a functional prototype to showcase a new digital user experience design for the brand, which resulted in a 2900% increase in funding year-over-year for Panera&rsquo;s web projects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>In 2012 Panera decided to embark on more than a website redesign, we embarked upon a journey of web unification, and the truth is that we failed. Up until that time, Panera &ndash; like most brands &ndash; had neglected their online presence for years. They had dozens of independent websites and micro-sites with zero coordinated planning, effort, or insight.</p>
        </div>

        </figure>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Unfortunately, we fell short of our goal. In fact, after the web unification project, no one wanted anything to do with anyone associated with the project. Though I the project turned out a disappointment, I was able to learn much from it and add new experiences to my toolkit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight bg-panera">
          <div class="text">
            <p>My pitch has always been that Panera would be best-served by building one website that synergizes the relationship between brand, customer, and commerce, driving efficiency in design, engineering, and technical debt, and gaining an advanced, single-source-of-truth for customer behavior (through personalization, analytics, and testing).</p>

          <p>So how do you convince the in-convincible? How do you turn the Titanic? The answer is: very slowly and methodically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text border">
          <h1>Turning the Titanic</h1>
          <p>After a couple of years of withering support for panerabread.com, I decided to take the initiative and prove to the company that we were missing big opportunities: opportunities to connect with users, as well as opportunities to increase revenue. I knew there was little appetite within the company for another website &#8220;redesign&#8221; project, so I began to position this an evolution of panerabread.com. We needed to be smarter and more strategic, and we needed a smart, concrete vision of what success could look like and how we could get there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Brief</h2>
          <p>Create a rendering to socialize and test a new strategy and new design for Panera Bread&rsquo;s digital ecosystem.</p>
          <h2>Audience</h2>
          <p>Panera&rsquo;s leadership team, internal stakeholders, and external partners.</p>
          <h2>Strategy</h2>
          <p>Highlight key strategic pillars to improve the site UX, drive engagement, brand messaging, and e-commerce across the user journey.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Intended Outcomes</h2>
          <p>Internal alignment on and approval of site strategies, tactics and concepts from key stakeholders to obtain funding for a site overhaul that addressed the entire customer journey through the marketing funnel, as well as support other business channels such as catering and gift cards.</p>
          <p>The aim externally was to grow awareness, acquisition, retention, and loyalty through an enhanced user experience designed to exceed key objectives and performance indicators.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Identifying the Biggest Problems</h2>
          <p>I conducted a series of user interviews with a broad spectrum of people: people who classified themselves as heavy users and light users. I interviewed customers, as well as people in the company to better qualify the site&rsquo;s biggest problems. The five biggest problems identified were:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><span></span>Site navigation and content organization are complicated and confusing and lack a direct drive to commerce.</li>
            <li><span></span>Search engine optimization and site analytics are poorly executed.
            <li><span></span>The site was not mobile-friendly.</li>
            <li><span></span>The site was impersonal and transactional. There was no joy in the user experience.</li>
            <li><span></span>The visual design of the site was already outdated and out-of-alignment with other brand efforts.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I also compared Panera&rsquo;s to other brands in order to better understand how we could improve our digital maturity. I conducted SEO keyword studies, meta tag analysis, global site ranking studies (for traffic, engagement, traffic sources, social integration, display ad impact, audience interests, and more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h3>Moments That Matter</h3>
          <p>I studied the site&rsquo;s analytics to better understand user behavior and pain points. This data showed clearly that there were three things that mattered most to users:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><span></span>Menu exploration</li>
            <li><span></span>Rewards</li>
            <li><span></span>Commerce</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h3>Business Objectives</h3>
          <p>After identifying the moments that matter, I engineered a new and improved user experience designed to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><span></span>Increase transaction referrals (and revenue) from the brand site</li>
            <li><span></span>Deepen brand engagement (recency, frequency, depth, and duration)</li>
            <li><span></span>Foster a better understanding of user behavior to enable iteration and optimization</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>I designed the first fully functional, responsive prototype for this new strategy and user experience in late 2016. I used actual live menu data in an effort to socialize the strategy with Panera&rsquo;s leadership team and demonstrate key pillars of a new user experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h3>Key Tactics</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><span></span>A modern, mobile-first responsive design</li>
            <li><span></span>Heightened transparency and priority given to rewards for known users</li>
            <li><span></span>Convenient and prominent paths to commerce including personalized options based on prior behavior</li>
            <li><span></span>Simplified navigation (based on the moments that matter) and content supporting Panera&rsquo;s brand values woven directly into the menu-browsing experience</li>
            <li><span></span>Promotion of other business channels, like gift cards and catering, as part of the content strategy</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight bg-panera">
          <div class="text">
            <p>I built modular components that could be reused throughout the site and by using a singular image size ratio to enable greater fidelity. Then, as the site came together it was easy and efficient to go back and fine-tune each component.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>The prototypes I developed were proofs of a concept designed to highlight the benefits of responsive design to key stakeholders, such as increased speed and efficiency in design and development, as well as a reduced technical code debt.</p>

          <p>In 2017 I provided guidance to design partner <a href="https://work.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Work &amp; Co.</a> for a new omni-channel digital design. As the visual design concept evolved, I was able to incorporate their designs into an updated responsive prototype that we could test in the browser, while maintaining the key strategic pillars I had outlined. The browser testing was intended to shorten the time from design to development and launch, as well as catch and correct issues before they became a problem.</p>
