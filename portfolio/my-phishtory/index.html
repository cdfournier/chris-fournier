            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>Create a visual rendering of the shows, songs and statistics of one Phish fan's brief history of loving the band.</p>
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>Phish fans and me.</p>
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p>Design a data-driven experience that uses statistics from <a href="http://phish.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phish.net</a> to highlight the shows, venues, cities, and songs for all of the Phish shows I attended, and connect each show to audio at <a href="http://phishtracks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phishtracks.com</a>.</p>

          <div class="copy" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>The first step was to create a list of all of the Phish shows I attended from 1994 to 2001. Next I created an extensive inventory of each show's details: the date, the venue and the set lists.</p>
            <p>I divided the site into three sections: the shows, the songs and the travel. I created a visual grid for each show featuring an image from either the show or the venue, as well as dates and cities and links to <a href="http://phish.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phish.net</a> and <a href="http://phishtracks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phishtracks.com</a>.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="copy" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
	          <p>For the songs section, it was important to portray the volume (a total of 919 songs played throughout the shows) and song statistics: songs heard the most and, of course, the longest jams.</p>
	          <p>I coded a customized Google Map using <a href="https://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gmaps.js</a> for the travel part of the site to illustrate all of the miles traveled across the United States for the forty-four shows in twenty cities.</p>
	          <p>As always, the site was designed mobile-first, and wound up being a fun resource I was able to use for reference.</p>
