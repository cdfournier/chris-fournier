            <h2>TL;DR Overview</h2>
            <p>In 2016 I began to study Panera&rsquo;s digital landscape, looking for ways to capitalize on its strengths as a brand and deliver an elevated digital experience to users. I recognized that the existing digital ecosystem was flawed, and there were missed opportunities to connect with users and drive e-commerce.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="animate">I successfully led the research, strategy, design, and build of a functional prototype to showcase a new digital user experience design for the brand, which resulted in a 2900% increase in funding year-over-year for Panera&rsquo;s web projects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text animate">
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>In 2012 Panera decided to embark on more than a website redesign, we embarked upon a journey of web unification, and the truth is that we failed. Up until that time, Panera &ndash; like most brands &ndash; had neglected their online presence for years. They had dozens of independent websites and micro-sites with zero coordinated planning, effort, or insight.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, we fell short of our goal. In fact, after the web unification project, no one wanted anything to do with anyone associated with the project. I was, however, able to learn much from it and add these new experiences to my toolkit.</p>

        <div class="highlight bg-panera">
          <div class="text animate">
            <p>My pitch has always been that Panera would be best-served by building one website that synergizes the relationship between brand, customer, and commerce, driving efficiency in design, engineering, and technical debt, and gaining an advanced, single-source-of-truth for customer behavior (through personalization, analytics, and testing).</p>

          <p>So how do you convince the in-convincible? How do you turn the Titanic? The answer is: very slowly and methodically.</p>

          <div class="group animate">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>I&rsquo;m often asked about process: how do I get from problem to design? It&rsquo;s not exactly mechanical, but it does follow a predictable path:</p>
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Listen</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Identify the problem(s) to be solved</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Strategize</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Create</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Test, iterate, and evolve</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="animate">One constant: I am always thinking about the design and experience. Everything I learn along the way gets added to the design and experience via iteration, but it all happens at the same time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text animate" style="margin: 3rem 0;">
          <h2 style="font-family: 'metropolis-bold', sans-serif; font-size: 3.502rem; line-height: 1;">Turning the Titanic</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">After a couple of years of withering support for panerabread.com, I decided to take the initiative and prove to the company that we were missing big opportunities: opportunities to connect with users, as well as opportunities to increase revenue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text animate">
          <p>I knew there was little appetite within the company for another website &#8220;redesign&#8221; project, so I began to position this an evolution of panerabread.com. We needed to be smarter and more strategic, and we needed a smart, concrete vision of what success could look like, as well as how we should get there &mdash; to leap over the middle ground between where we were and where we needed to be.</p>
          <p>I began an analysis to compare Panera to other brands to better understand how we could improve our digital maturity. I conducted SEO keyword studies, meta tag analysis, and global site ranking studies (for traffic, engagement, traffic sources, social activity, display ad impact, audience interests, and more). My first report on the subject was nearly 700 pages.</p>

            <h3>Identifying the Biggest Problems</h3>
            <p>In order to hone in on the biggest problems, I conducted a series of user interviews with a broad spectrum of people: people who classified themselves as heavy users and light users. I interviewed customers, as well as people in the company to better qualify the site&rsquo;s biggest problems. The five biggest problems identified were:</p>
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Site navigation and content organization were complicated and confusing and lacked a direct drive to commerce.</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Search engine optimization and site analytics were poorly executed.
            <li class="animate"><span></span>The site was not mobile-friendly.</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>The site was impersonal and transactional. There was no joy in the user experience.</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>The visual design of the site was already outdated and out-of-alignment with other brand efforts.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <div class="group animate">
            <h3>Moments That Matter</h3>
            <p>I studied the site&rsquo;s analytics to better understand user behavior and pain points. This data showed clearly that there were three things that mattered most to users:</p>
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Menu exploration</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Rewards</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Commerce</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="group animate">
            <h3>Business Objectives</h3>
            <p>After identifying the moments that matter, I engineered a new and improved user experience designed to:</p>
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Increase transaction referrals (and revenue) from the brand site</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Deepen brand engagement (recency, frequency, depth, and duration)</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Foster a better understanding of user behavior to enable iteration and optimization</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <h3 class="animate">Key Tactics</h3>
          <ol>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>A modern, mobile-first responsive design</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Heightened transparency and priority given to rewards for known users</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Convenient and prominent paths to commerce including personalized options based on prior behavior</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Simplified navigation (based on the moments that matter) and content supporting Panera&rsquo;s brand values woven directly into the menu-browsing experience</li>
            <li class="animate"><span></span>Promotion of other business channels, like gift cards and catering, as part of the content strategy</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="text animate">
          <p>I designed the first fully functional, responsive prototype for this new strategy and user experience in late 2016. I used actual live menu data in an effort to socialize the strategy with Panera&rsquo;s leadership team and demonstrate the key pillars of a new user experience.</p>

            <p>I built modular components that could be reused throughout the site and by using a singular image size ratio to enable greater fidelity. Then, as the site came together it was easy and efficient to go back and fine-tune each component.</p>

          <p>The prototypes I designed and developed were proofs of a concept to test not only the user experience, but also to highlight the benefits of responsive design (including reduced cost and increased speed and efficiency in both design and development, as well as a much smaller code debt) to key stakeholders.</p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>My strategy, user experience design,  and functional prototypes were successful: I convinced Panera&rsquo;s senior leadership to approve <em>a 2900% increase in funding year-over-year</em> for panerabread.com.</p>

          <p>In 2017 I provided guidance to design partner <a href="https://work.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Work &amp; Co.</a> for a new omni-channel digital design. As the visual design concept evolved, I was able to incorporate their designs into an updated responsive prototype &ndash; we could test in the browser while also maintaining the key strategic pillars I had outlined. The browser testing was intended to shorten the time from design to development and launch, as well as catch and correct issues before they became a problem.</p>
